# Sustainability Claims in Fast Fashion and Customers’ Buying Intention & WTP: An Analysis

We analyzed the [dataset](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Data_underlining_publication_Communicating_sustainable_shoes_to_mainstream_consumers_the_impact_of_advertising_design_on_buying_intention/14686680) associated with a [study by Delft University](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/7/7/8420) in the Netherlands that had valid data from 200 participants. The study involved an experiment with 3 ad poster design options for Bata Corporation, a European multinational footwear and fashion accessory manufacturer and retailer. The poster options emphasized 3 different aspects:
* Environmental messaging
* Layout color scheme
* Brand heritage 

Our primary variables of interest are the importance of sustainability and customers’ WTP. We performed linear as well as multivariate regressions. We also conducted a hypothesis test and generated a classic discrete decision tree.
